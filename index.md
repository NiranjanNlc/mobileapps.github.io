# Mobile Applications

Built on top of the Fineract APIs, the Mifos Initiative maintains a suite of staff and client-facing mobile apps to enable field-based operations and deliver an omni-channel banking experience for clients.

These apps can be used out-of-the-box for demonstration purposes, they can be white-labeled, extended and hardened for use in production or they can serve as the starting point for a new mobile application. 

This page is to help you understand the use cases each of the apps caters to whether you’re a financial institution or fintech looking to consume it or a developer looking to contribute to it. In addition you can find the github repository, a link to the latest APK, and the issue tracker/roadmap for ongoing development. 

Included on this page is information related to apps built on top of Fineract 1.x (Generation 2) and apps built on Fineract CN (Generation 3) 

# Self-Service Applications

## Mobile Banking App: 
Mobile Banking Applications are essentially a mobile interface to allow for a client to interact with the accounts they hold at a financial institution - typically they can view details of their loan/savings accounts, transfer money between accounts, and transfer money to other users.

## Personal Financial Management App
A PFM app would allow clients or small businesses to track their expenditures, savings, and cash flows to have better visibility into their financial well-being. This could be built as a stand-alone app or functionality as subset of a mobile wallet, mobile banking or digital credit app.


## Digital Credit App
Digital Credit Applications are client-facing apps for the self-service application for, disbursement, and repayment of loans via a mobile phone. Leveraging mobile money, this lending limits in-person contact facilitating low-cost lending based on loan origination guided by big data and advanced analytics.
